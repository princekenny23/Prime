## Recommended Category Structure

For a typical restaurant, we recommend starting with these **essential categories**:

1. **Appetizers**
2. **Main Dishes**
3. **Sides**
4. **Desserts**
5. **Beverages**
6. **Specials**

You can expand from there based on your menu.

## Category Creation Tips

1. **Keep it simple** - Start with 5-10 main categories
2. **Be consistent** - Use clear, descriptive names
3. **Think like customers** - Categories should match how customers think about your menu
4. **Avoid too many** - Too many categories can be confusing
